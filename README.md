Daily Cloud Security Progress :-I document my daily AWS and cloud security learning here to show consistent hands-on growth and real-world practice.

DAY :1 

Topic :- Basic Knowledge about AWS

Today I learned the basics of Amazon Web Services and how cloud computing works. AWS provides computing power, storage, databases, and networking through the internet, so companies do not need to buy or maintain physical servers. Everything runs on a pay as you go model, which makes it flexible and cost effective.

I also explored some of the core AWS services like EC2 for virtual machines, S3 for storage, IAM for user and permission management, and RDS for databases. These services are the foundation of most cloud based applications.

This helped me understand how real world applications are built and managed in the cloud, which is an important step in my journey toward cloud security.


DAY :2


 Topic: AWS IAM – Users, Groups & Policies  

- Studied how IAM controls access to AWS resources  
- Created IAM users and assigned them to groups  
- Applied least-privilege policies for security  
- Practiced generating access keys and enabling MFA  
- Tested permissions from AWS Console  

*What I learned:*  
IAM is the foundation of AWS security. Without proper identity and permission control, cloud infrastructure is vulnerable. Understanding users, roles, and policies is critical for building secure cloud environments.


Day 3 :- 

After a few days of health issues, I’m finally back to learning and building again.
Sometimes life pauses the routine, but it should never stop the journey.

Today, I continued my cloud learning path by working hands-on with Amazon EC2.
This session helped me understand how real servers are created, secured, and managed in the cloud.

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) lets you create virtual servers in minutes. Instead of buying physical machines, you can launch, scale, and manage servers on demand. It feels like having a global data center at your fingertips.

What makes EC2 powerful is not just launching a server, but the control and flexibility behind it.

I launched my first EC2 instance on AWS, connected to it through SSH, and saw how a real cloud server actually works. What really stood out was learning about Security Groups. They are like digital gatekeepers that decide who can access your server and how.
By setting rules for ports like SSH and HTTP, I realized how much security depends on small configuration choices. One wrong rule can expose everything. One correct rule can protect your system.
This session showed me that cloud is not just theory. It’s real, practical, and powerful when you understand how the pieces connect.
Slowly, step by step, I’m building my cloud and security foundation.



Day 4 :-

Today I explored Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and honestly, it made the idea of cloud storage much clearer for me.
Think of EBS like a hard drive in the cloud that you attach to an EC2 instance.
Your server can stop, restart, or even crash, but your data on EBS stays safe and ready to use again.
What really stood out to me is how reliable and flexible EBS is.


Day 5 :-
🧠 Just finished watching a great tutorial on AWS AMIs: “AWS AMI Explained: Create Custom EC2 Images and Templates in Minutes!” (Hindi).

This video breaks down Amazon Machine Images, demonstrating how to create custom AMIs from EC2 instances and explaining why they matter in cloud automation and infrastructure provisioning.

Key learnings:
✔ What AMIs are and how they work in EC2  
✔ How to create, configure, and use custom AMIs  
✔ Practical steps to launch consistent environments  
✔ How AMIs fit into scalable AWS workflows

Very beginner-friendly and practical for cloud engineers and anyone building infrastructure automation with AWS. Highly recommended for your AWS learning path! 🚀

Day 6 :-
Today I learned how Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) work together in AWS to build scalable and highly available applications.
This video clearly explained:
How ELB distributes traffic across EC2 instances
How ASG automatically adds or removes servers based on load
How both services integrate to avoid downtime and save cost
Understanding this architecture is a big step toward real-world cloud engineering.
Excited to apply this in my own AWS projects. 🚀
