# AWs cloud journey



Today I learned the basics of Amazon Web Services and how cloud computing works. AWS provides computing power, storage, databases, and networking through the internet, so companies do not need to buy or maintain physical servers. Everything runs on a pay as you go model, which makes it flexible and cost effective.

I also explored some of the core AWS services like EC2 for virtual machines, S3 for storage, IAM for user and permission management, and RDS for databases. These services are the foundation of most cloud based applications.

This helped me understand how real world applications are built and managed in the cloud, which is an important step in my journey toward cloud security.
