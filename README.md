# AWs cloud journey

Daily Cloud Security Progress :-I document my daily AWS and cloud security learning here to show consistent hands-on growth and real-world practice.

DAY :1 

Topic :- Basic Knowledge about AWS

Today I learned the basics of Amazon Web Services and how cloud computing works. AWS provides computing power, storage, databases, and networking through the internet, so companies do not need to buy or maintain physical servers. Everything runs on a pay as you go model, which makes it flexible and cost effective.

I also explored some of the core AWS services like EC2 for virtual machines, S3 for storage, IAM for user and permission management, and RDS for databases. These services are the foundation of most cloud based applications.

This helped me understand how real world applications are built and managed in the cloud, which is an important step in my journey toward cloud security.


DAY :2


 Topic: AWS IAM – Users, Groups & Policies  

- Studied how IAM controls access to AWS resources  
- Created IAM users and assigned them to groups  
- Applied least-privilege policies for security  
- Practiced generating access keys and enabling MFA  
- Tested permissions from AWS Console  

*What I learned:*  
IAM is the foundation of AWS security. Without proper identity and permission control, cloud infrastructure is vulnerable. Understanding users, roles, and policies is critical for building secure cloud environments.
